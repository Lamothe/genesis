# Genesis — 3D scene editor

Multi-model scene manipulator (move, rotate, scale) for VR, with free-flight
first-person controls and an OpenXR shell. Built to have the DLSS5 neural
renderer bolted on later through the seam contract
(`NEURAL-SEAM.md`, `neural-seam.h`).

## Layout

- `include/vecmath.h` — Vec2/Vec3/Quat/Mat4/Ray/Aabb, TRS, affine inverse, decompose
- `include/scene.h`, `src/scene.cpp` — transform hierarchy, cached world
  matrices, `epoch()` discontinuity counter
- `include/picking.h`, `src/picking.cpp` — ray/AABB, ray/triangle (Möller–
  Trumbore), closest-hit selection
- `include/gizmo.h`, `src/gizmo.cpp` — translate/rotate/scale drags, world/local
  space, axis/plane/free handles, snapping, drift-free cumulative application
- `include/camera.h`, `src/camera.cpp` — orbit camera, screen→ray, pan/dolly
- `include/handles.h`, `src/handles.cpp` — gizmo handle geometry (single source
  for drawing *and* hit testing) + screen-space pick resolution
- `include/mesh.h`, `src/mesh.cpp` — vertex/mesh/model data types
- `include/json.h`, `src/json.cpp` — strict JSON DOM (arena-based) for glTF
- `include/gltf.h`, `src/gltf.cpp` — glTF 2.0 binary (`.glb`) loader
- `include/obj.h`, `src/obj.cpp` — Wavefront OBJ + MTL (`Kd`) loader
- `app/vk_renderer.*` — Vulkan 1.3 viewport renderer (dynamic rendering;
  XCB/swapchain windowed mode, offscreen mode with RGBA8 readback; registered
  indexed meshes, built-in cube is mesh 0)
- `app/geometry.*` — cube, floor grid, handle-line geometry
- `app/editor_app.cpp` — XCB window, input, selection, gizmo wiring, model
  loading (`.glb`/`.obj` on the command line), smoke modes
- `shaders/` — GLSL (compiled by `glslc` at launch)
- `tests/test_core.cpp` — maths, parser and behaviour tests

## Build and test

```sh
bash run-tests.sh        # core tests (435 checks; image fixtures via ImageMagick)
bash run-editor.sh       # build + interactive editor
bash run-editor.sh model.glb other.obj   # load models (textures via glTF/OBJ materials)
bash run-editor.sh model.glb --xr        # VR session via OpenXR (WiVRn etc.)
bash run-editor.sh --smoke-offscreen     # render + pixel assertions
bash run-editor.sh --smoke-textured      # texture sampling end-to-end
bash run-editor.sh --smoke-window 30     # windowed present path
bash run-editor.sh --smoke-xr            # XR frame loop (SKIP without a runtime)
```

`run-tests.sh` compiles with `g++ -std=c++20 -Wall -Wextra -Werror`;
`run-editor.sh` compiles the shell and shaders and runs it. Thin shell launchers
only: **all project logic is typed C/C++ (project rule — no Python)**.

## Controls

Free-flight, first-person (VR-friendly): **WASD** move, **Q/E** down/up,
**Shift** boost, **RMB** mouse-look, **MMB** or **Shift+RMB** pan, **wheel** fly
forward/back.

**LMB** selects and drags the gizmo: a click selects the whole model under the
cursor, **Shift+LMB** or **Ctrl+LMB** selects a single part. **1**/**G**
translate, **2**/**R** rotate, **3** scale, **L** world/local space, **Ctrl**
snap, **Ctrl-Z** undo (cancels a live grab), **Ctrl-Y** / **Ctrl-Shift-Z**
redo, **Esc** quits. The gizmo sits at the centre of the selection's bounds;
the selection is tinted and outlined.

In VR the trigger selects the whole model and grip+trigger selects a single
part — grip doubles as the snap/boost modifier, mirroring Ctrl's desktop
overlap. Moving is a deliberate two-step: the first press only *selects*, and
a second press on the already-selected target *grabs* it — hold and point
where it should go, and the model slides on the ground plane following the
point where your aim beam meets the floor (pointing at a spot places it there
fast, aiming close gives precise nudges). It never lifts off the floor;
release drops it as one undo step. This way a wobbly trigger press can only
change the selection — it can never move anything — and a re-press within
100 ms of a release is treated as a controller bounce, not a second click.
Aim at a gizmo handle instead for precise axis/rotate/scale work — a handle
wins only where it is nearer than the model surface, so grabbing the body is
what happens when you press the model itself. Handles brighten when hovered;
the selection is shown by the warm tint and the gizmo sitting at the
selection's centre. Left stick flies where you look — point down and fly to
descend, which is how you adjust your own height; strafing stays level.
Right stick turns (X) and looks up/down (Y); turning pivots on your head, so
you spin in place rather than orbiting the tracking origin, and the ground
stays level with gravity.

## Design notes

- **Gizmo drags are cumulative from drag start**, not incremental per event:
  every update recomputes the total delta and re-applies it to captured start
  transforms, so rounding cannot accumulate.
- **Scene transforms are TRS only.** Nested non-uniform scale under rotation can
  introduce shear that TRS cannot represent; the gizmo maths assumes shear-free
  hierarchies. Fine for editor content; revisit if a rig ever needs it.
- **Discontinuity**: any transform or structural change bumps `Scene::epoch()`;
  the seam maps that to `reset = 1` for the temporal loop. Selection changes do
  not bump it.
- The caller resolves which gizmo handle was grabbed (the renderer knows where
  handles were drawn); this core only does the drag maths and applies it.

## Roadmap

1. ~~Vulkan desktop shell~~ — done: windowed + offscreen renderer, camera,
   selection, gizmo handles and drag wiring (16/10/2026).
2. ~~glTF 2.0 (`.glb`) + OBJ loading in C++~~ — done (17/10/2026): strict JSON
   DOM, GLB container/accessor reader (strided/interleaved, normalised colours),
   OBJ/MTL loader, registered indexed meshes, per-mesh bounds picking.
3. ~~Textures + free-flight camera~~ — done (17/10/2026): hand-written PNG and
   baseline JPEG decoders (typed C++, zlib for inflate), glTF baseColorTexture
   and OBJ map_Kd with alpha modes (opaque/mask/blend) and material alpha,
   first-person free flight (WASD/QE, mouse-look, wheel dolly).
4. ~~WiVRn/OpenXR VR shell: stereo views through the same interface~~ — done
   (17/10/2026): XR_KHR_vulkan_enable2 shell in app/xr_shell.cpp (per-eye
   swapchains, LOCAL space, action set for Quest/Vive/simple controllers),
   rig-based free-flight locomotion composed with the head pose, controller
   aim-ray gizmo interaction (pickHandleByRay in the core), `--xr` /
   `--smoke-xr` (honest SKIP without a runtime). Needs a live OpenXR runtime
   (WiVRn) for first in-headset tuning of bindings and comfort.
5. Bind `neural_seam_evaluate` to the native evaluator when the migration
   stream's full native evaluation lands; conform the seam's convention table to
   the pinned native input conventions at that point.

## Git

Standalone project at `~/Projects/Genesis`, extracted from the DLSS5 VR
repo's `scene-editor` branch (history preserved). The DLSS5 side consumes
the seam contract (`NEURAL-SEAM.md`) when the native evaluation stream is
ready.
